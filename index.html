<h2 id ="r">Cereals:</h2>
<h3 id="a">Wheat:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="Wheat.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
<br>
<p id ="da">Wheat is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food.There are many species of wheat which together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat

The archaeological record suggests that wheat was first cultivated in the regions of the Fertile Crescent around 9600 BCE. Botanically, the wheat kernel is a type of fruit called a caryopsis.

Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop (220.4 million hectares, 2014).World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined.In 2016, world production of wheat was 749 million tonnes,making it the second most-produced cereal after maize.Since 1960, world production of wheat and other grain crops has tripled and is expected to grow further through the middle of the 21st century<p>
<br>
<h3 id="b">Maize:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="maize.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
<br>
<p id="ab">Maize,also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in southern Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The leafy stalk of the plant produces separate pollen and ovuliferous inflorescences or ears, which are fruits, yielding kernels or seeds.</p>

<p id="bc">Maize has become a staple food in many parts of the world, with total production surpassing that of wheat or rice. However not all of this maize is consumed directly by humans. Some of the maize production is used for corn ethanol, animal feed and other maize products, such as corn starch and corn syrup. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="c">Rice:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="rice.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
<br>
<p id="dc">Rice is the seed of the grass species Oryza sativa (Asian rice) or Oryza glaberrima (African rice). As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production (rice, 741.5 million tonnes in 2014), after sugarcane (1.9 billion tonnes) and maize (1.0 billion tonnes.</p>

<p id ="src">Rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. There are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.</p>

<p id="za">Rice is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. However, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="d">Barley:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="barley.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
<br>
<p id="gh">Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), a member of the grass family, is a major cereal grain grown in temperate climates globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in Eurasia as early as 10,000 years ago.</p>

<p id="ui">Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.In 2014, barley was ranked fourth among grains in quantity produced (144 million tonnes) behind corn, rice and wheat</p>
<br>
<h3 id="e">Oat:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="oat.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
<p id="aq">Oat (Avena sativa), sometimes called the common oat, is a species of cereal grain grown for its seed, which is known by the same name (usually in the plural, unlike other cereals and pseudocereals). While oats are suitable for human consumption as oatmeal and rolled oats, one of the most common uses is as livestock feed. Oats are a nutrient-rich food associated with lower blood cholesterol when consumed regularly.</p>

<p id ="al">Avenins present in oats (proteins similar to gliadin from wheat) can trigger celiac disease in a small proportion of people.Also, oat products are frequently contaminated by other gluten-containing grains, mainly wheat and barley.</p><br>

<h2 id="s">Pulses:</h2>
<h3 id="a">Green Gram:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="mung.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle";></center>
<p id ="da">The mung bean (Vigna radiata), alternatively known as the moong bean, green gram, or mung.It is a species of the legume family. The mung bean is mainly cultivated in India, China, Korea, and Southeast Asia. It is used as an ingredient in both savory and sweet dishes.Whole cooked mung beans are generally prepared from dried beans by boiling until they are soft. Mung beans are light yellow in colour when their skins are removed.Mung bean paste can be made by dehulling, cooking, and pulverizing the beans to a dry paste.
Although whole mung beans are also occasionally used in Indian cuisine, beans without skins are more commonly used; but in Kerala & Tamil Nadu, whole mung beans are commonly boiled to make a dry preparation often served with rice gruel</p>
<br>
<h3 id="b">Black Gram:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="black.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle";></center>
<p id ="ab">Vigna mungo, black gram, urad bean, mungo bean or black matpe bean (Sanskrit: ???, m??a) is a bean grown in the Indian subcontinent. At one time it was considered to belong to the same species as the mung bean. The product sold as black lentil is usually the whole urad bean, whereas the split bean (the interior being white) is called white lentil. It should not to be confused with the much smaller true black lentil (Lens culinaris).</p>

<p id ="bc">Black gram originated in India, where it has been in cultivation from ancient times and is one of the most highly prized pulses of India and Pakistan. It is very widely used in the Punjabi Cuisine and is often referred to as "maa di daal" in the native language by Punjabis. The Coastal Andhra region in Andhra Pradesh is famous for black gram after paddy. The Guntur District ranks first in Andhra Pradesh for the production of black gram. Black gram has also been introduced to other tropical areas mainly by Indian immigrants.</p>
<h3 id="c">Red Gram:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="download.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
<br>
<p id="dc">The red gram/pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) is a perennial legume from the family Fabaceae. Since its domestication in India at least 3,500 years ago, its seeds have become a common food grain in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It is consumed on a large scale mainly in south Asia and is a major source of protein for the population of that subcontinent.
</p>

<p id ="src">The red gram is known by numerous names with different etymologies, no-eye pea, tropical green pea, gungo pea in Jamaica, red gram and gandule bean.</p>

<p id="za">Today, pigeon pea is widely cultivated in all tropical and semitropical regions of both the Old and the New Worlds. Pigeon peas can be of a perennial variety, in which the crop can last three to five years (although the seed yield drops considerably after the first two years), or an annual variety more suitable for seed production.

Pigeon pea is an important legume crop of rainfed agriculture in the semiarid tropics. The Indian subcontinent, eastern Africa and Central America, in that order, are the world's three main pigeon pea-producing regions. Pigeon peas are cultivated in more than 25 tropical and subtropical countries, either as a sole crop or intermixed with cereals, such as sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum), or maize (Zea mays), or with other legumes, such as peanuts (Arachis hypogaea). Being a legume capable of symbiosis with Rhizobia, the pigeon pea enriches soil through symbiotic nitrogen fixation.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="d">Peas:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="peas.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
<br>
<p id="gh">The pea is most commonly the small spherical seed or the seed-pod of the pod fruit Pisum sativum.[2] Each pod contains several peas. Pea pods are botanically fruit,[3] since they contain seeds and developed from the ovary of a (pea) flower. The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), the cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), and the seeds from several species of Lathyrus.</p>

<p id="ui">P. sativum is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36 grams.[4] The immature peas (and in snow peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from the matured pod. These are the basis of pease porridge and pea soup, staples of medieval cuisine; in Europe, consuming fresh immature green peas was an innovation of Early Modern cuisine.</p>
<br>
<h3 id="e">Chick pea:</h3>
<br>
<center><img src="chick pea.jpg";style="vertical-align:middle"></center>
<p id="aq">The chickpea or chick pea (Cicer arietinum) is a legume of the family Fabaceae, subfamily Faboideae.Its different types are variously known as gram,or Bengal gram, garbanzo or garbanzo bean, Egyptian pea.Its seeds are high in protein. It is one of the earliest cultivated legumes: 7,500-year-old remains have been found in the Middle East.</p>

<p id ="al">Domesticated chickpeas have been found in the aceramic levels of Jericho (PPNB) along with Çayönü in Turkey and in Neolithic pottery at Hacilar, Turkey. They were found in the late Neolithic (about 3500 BC) at Thessaly, Kastanas, Lerna and Dimini, Greece. In southern France, Mesolithic layers in a cave at L'Abeurador, Aude, have yielded wild chickpeas carbon dated to 6790±90 BC.
Chickpeas are mentioned in Charlemagne's Capitulare de villis (about 800 AD) as cicer italicum, as grown in each imperial demesne. Albertus Magnus mentions red, white, and black varieties. Nicholas Culpeper noted "chick-pease or cicers" are less "windy" than peas and more nourishing. Ancient people also associated chickpeas with Venus because they were said to offer medical uses such as increasing sperm and milk, provoking menstruation and urine, and helping to treat kidney stones."White cicers" were thought to be especially strong and helpful.</p>
